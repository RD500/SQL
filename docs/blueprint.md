# **App Name**: SQL ARcade

## Core Features:

- SQL Basics Quests: Interactive tutorials and 2D AR-like visualizations for SQL commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN. Challenges and quests with increasing difficulty.
- Constraint Challenges: Interactive lessons on Primary Key (PK), Foreign Key (FK), Unique, and Check constraints. AR-like 2D visualizations highlight constraint relationships. Instant feedback on constraint violations.
- Normalization Puzzles: Challenges that involve fixing messy tables with anomalies using drag and drop attributes to create smaller normalized tables, ranging from 1NF to BCNF.
- Gamified Progress: Gamification to incentivize players, including a storyline about curing 'sick databases', badges, titles (e.g., Key Master, Schema Surgeon), and a progress map through SQL Basics, Constraints, and Normalization.
- AI Tutoring Tool: AI-powered assistant that provides contextual help using an LLM. Pulls from curated notes, solved examples, and DBMS textbooks via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for syllabus-aligned guidance.
- Adaptive Learning: Adapts difficulty based on student performance; simplifying examples and hints after repeated struggles. Natural Language to SQL: Converts natural language queries (e.g., "Show me all employees earning more than 50,000") into SQL. Step-by-step transformation (NL -> SQL).
- Dataset Loader: User has an ability to upload a dataset (CSV or other) that then becomes available to explore

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to represent the complexity and depth of databases, as well as knowledge and wisdom.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F3E5F5), near white, to ensure legibility of content and a clean UI.
- Accent color: Electric Green (#7CFC00) to highlight key elements, actions, and interactive components, in order to suggest energy, motion and growth.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying SQL code snippets and query results clearly.
- Use clean, geometric icons related to database concepts, constraints, and normalization processes.
- Subtle animations to represent table relationships and query execution in the AR-like 2D visualizations.
